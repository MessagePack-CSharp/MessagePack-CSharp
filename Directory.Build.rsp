#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file contains command-line options that MSBuild will process as part of
# every build, unless the "/noautoresponse" switch is specified.
#
# MSBuild processes the options in this file first, before processing the
# options on the command line. As a result, options on the command line can
# override the options in this file. However, depending on the options being
# set, the overriding can also result in conflicts.
#
# NOTE: The "/noautoresponse" switch cannot be specified in this file, nor in
# any response file that is referenced by this file.
